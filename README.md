Staff Paper
===========

staff_paper is a JavaScript library for rendering simple music notation in the browser. It uses the RaphaÃ«l vector graphics library for cross-browser compatible graphics.

It is currently in pre-release, and will remain undocumented for a while longer until the library takes shape.
